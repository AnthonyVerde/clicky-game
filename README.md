# Clicky Game

Let's test your memory! 

Your goal is to click on each logo only once â€” if you click a logo more than once, you have to start over. The catch is, once you click on a logo, the entire array of logos is reordered so no logo will be where you last saw it.

The game displays your current score (increases each time you click a logo) and displays your highest score (the number of logos clicked before clicking on one a second time). See if you can beat that score!

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), ES6, CSS, and Bootstrap. Logos are curated from [Clearbit Logo API](https://clearbit.com/logo).

Thanks for viewing!
